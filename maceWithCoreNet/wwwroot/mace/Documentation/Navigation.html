    <h3>Via URL</h3>
    <p>
        Navigation by URL is what you would expect.  Incoming URL is mapped to a ViewContainer through the ViewContainer.UrlPattern method.  The ViewContainer contains View(s) that should be associated with the URL.

    <h3>Via SPA</h3>
    <p>
        Navigation through SPA utilizes the mace.js prototype method 'Show' (example: window.Show({ViewContainerType}, parameters);).
